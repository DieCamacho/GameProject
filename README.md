# Cthulhu Dungeon Crawler

## Idea
Our current game idea is within the genre of 2D, side scrolling, co-op, brawler with elements of a roguelike game. 

## Game Plan
As of right now, we are deciding between whether the map should be platformer style or linear side scrolling style but the game mechanics should be the same regardless. The players will have 3 actions available to them, moving, attacking, and using their item. The player will progress through the stages that also have a storyline associated with them with each stage containing around 3 maps to complete a final boss at the end of the stage. The last stage will contain a final grand boss which will have maybe 3 phases in which you must bring him down to 0 health on all 3 to complete the game. 

The roguelike elements will come in the form of upgrades and items. The upgrades can be bought using currency that will be dropped by monsters or found in loot stashes in the maps. The upgrades will consist of higher hp, different attack style(knockback, double shoot), more damage, etc. We want to aim for around 5 to 8 unique items which all provide different utilities such as party healing, or teleport, and these will also be bought with currency. The amount of playable characters will be around 4, each with a different weapon and each starts with a fixed unique item from the total pool of unique items.

## Theme
The theme of the game will be an H.P. Lovecraftian theme so the art will have a very gothic style, the time period will be early 1920’s and the bosses will be based on the Great Old Ones (Cthulhu). The style of art will be pixel art because we enjoy the aesthetic and it is also not too penalizing for lacking artistic skill. 

## Game Progress
As of right now we have created the 3 main animations, idle, walking and shooting, for the first playable character. Our plan right now is to create one instance of a playable character, enemy and map so that we can get the basics of the game running so later one we can just reuse the classes but with different stats.
